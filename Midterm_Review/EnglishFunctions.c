* FUNCTION:   int is_it_alphabet(signed char inputChar);
*
* ARGUMENTS:  inputChar is a single signed character that represents a single character
*                 that is tested as an alphabet letter.
*
* RETURNS:	  1 if inputChar is an alphabet character
*             0 if inputChar is not an alphabet character
*
* NOTES:      This function should not care if inputChar is uppercase or lowercase
*             The return value represents a boolean response without using a 'bool' data type
*             The letters a through z and A through Z represent "alphabet letters" for
*                 the purposes of this assignment.

* FUNCTION:   int remove_non_letters(char * sentenceString);
*
* ARGUMENTS:  senteceString is expected to be a pointer to a null-terminated string
*
* RETURNS:	  Number of characters that were removed
*             -1 if sentenceString is NULL
*
* NOTES:      The execution of this function must utilize is_it_alphabet() to determine
*                 whether or not a given char is an alphabet letter or not.
*             In addition to removing non-alphabet letters, this function will also remove any
*                 "blank space".
*             Most importantly, sentenceString will be null-terminated before the function returns

/*
* FUNCTION:   int reverse_string(char * inputString, char * outputBuff, int inputPosition);
*
* ARGUMENTS:  inputString is expected to be a pointer to a null-terminated string
*             outputBuff is expected to be a pointer to a char array which will store the reversed string from inputString
*             inputPosition is the element of inputString that reverse_string() should reverse
*
* RETURNS:	  Number of characters that were reversed
*             -1 if either inputString or outputBuff is NULL
*             -2 if inputPosition is unrealistic
*                 Examples:
*                     inputPosition is negative
*                     inputPosition is out of the array's scope
*
* NOTES:      This function can be done either itterativly or recursively. Skip over null-terminated input validation!
*
*
*			  Recursive:
*                 1. Reverse inputString[inputPosition] into outputBuff[]
*                 2. Call reverse_string() to reverse the next inputString[] position
*                 3. Count and return the total number of characters that were reversed from inputString[]
*                        into outputBuff[]
*             outputBuff is treated as the same length as inputString.  If outputBuff is longer, it
*                 will still be treated the same length as inputString.  Ideally, outputBuff and inputString
*                 are the exact same length.
*             Most importantly, outputBuff will be null-terminated before the function returns
*
*			 Itterative:
*				  1. Do input checks and return errors if needed
*				  2. LOOP: Reverse inputString[inputLength - i - 1] into outputBuff
*				  3. Count and return the total number of characters that were reversed from inputString[]
*
*				  Ensuring you start at the end of inputString and itterate until you have reached the
*				  inputPosition is very important.
*					EXAMPLE:
*					someArray[] = "Hello World"
*					inputPosition = 3
*					outputBuff = dlroW ol"

/*
* FUNCTION:   int clear_a_buffer(char * fullBuff, int buffSize);
*
* ARGUMENTS:  fullBuff is expected to be a pointer to a char array
*             buffSize represents the dimension of fullBuff[]
*
* RETURNS:	  0 on success
*             -1 if fullBuff is NULL
*             -2 if buffSize is unrealistic
*                 Examples:
*                     buffSize is zero
*                     buffSize is negative
*
* NOTES:      This function 'zeroizes' all of the elements of fullBuff[buffSize]
*             fullBuff does not necessarily need to be a null-terminated string since the array's
*                 dimension is passed in as an argument (for safety)
